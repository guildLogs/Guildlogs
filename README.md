Guild Mission statement


The adventurers’ guilds is a performance art piece that attempts to Gamify personal development and community resilience building.My ultimate goal is to combat the alienation of the modern world and help as many people as possible.


The 5 tenants
Whimsy
• The guild is a place for fun and I hope to inject a bit of wonder into my acts of kindness.
Growth
• Humans are not stagnant creatures, we have an amazing ability to learn new things and this is a place to do it. You can gain hands-on experience through a low stakes quest or from our zine library and grimoire program.
Reuse
• I carry respect for all things natural or unnatural so out of respect for the work that was put into building something I want to get as much use out of it as possible. Items you on their way to the trash have way less stakes, it's a wonderful opportunity to experiment and try new things.
Building bonds 
• Humans are social creatures and history has taught us that when we work together we can accomplish amazing things. The world is a big scary place. It helps to know that others have your back.
Dreams and creativity 
• Another wonderful trait of humans is our ability to dream. We can imagine something and turn it into reality which is quite beautiful.
